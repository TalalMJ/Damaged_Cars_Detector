# MVP
> In our project we are trying to analyze and detect the damages in the car body using images, hoping to build a model to assist certain entity in damaged cars capturing using deep learning methods.
>
> For a starter, we tried to use a deep learning model from [amazon aws](https://s3.amazonaws.com/deep-learning-models/image-models/imagenet_class_index.json) and with cnn architecture [vgg16](https://neurohive.io/en/popular-networks/vgg16/) to see how it predict every image, that results in producing list of occurances of every prediction.

> here a close up look to the first 10 types of prediction

### In further steps, we are planning to classify the images whether to be damaged or not, and try to locate the place of damages in every car.
