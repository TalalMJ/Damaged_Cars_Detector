# Damaged Cars Detector
In car industry or any other business related cars, there have been always the need to check and examine cars for any sort of damage, but mostly they mitigate these issues with primitive solutions, which cost time, effort, and resources. 

We are hoping to fillful those needs with more advanced methods using deeplearning in analyzing images of cars and detect there body damages,but we are so determent to build a model that can be considered as an added value to any industry that is related to cars.

# Goals
* Predict if the car is damaged or not damaged to help Ministry Of Interior (MOI).
* Detect Car damage extent of severty.

# Data Description
Our data are collected from kaggle, and it is about 2000+ images of fine or damaged cars:
 * [Car damage detection](https://www.kaggle.com/anujms/car-damage-detection)
 * [Coco Car Damage Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/lplenka/coco-car-damage-detection-dataset)
 * [Car damage](https://www.kaggle.com/mohitagarwal816/car-damage)

# Tools
* Technologies: Python, Jupyter notebook, VSCode.
* Libraries: Seaborn, Matplotlib, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Sklearn, Tensorflow, Pickle.
